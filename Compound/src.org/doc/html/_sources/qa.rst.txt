**Where is the documentation of the various functions?**
  You have 3 options:
  
  1. Use the included html documentation (the one your're reading now) and look for
     the function in the API reference or Module Index. You can also use the search function.

  2. Once you've imported a module or function in python, you can type help(<function_or_module>)
     to view the documentatoin.

  3. Use the buildin documentation features of your IDE such as pycharm or spyder.

**How do I get started?**
  Follow the installation instructions in this document and then proceed with the examples.

**What is regarded as abuse?**
  Scripts that try to 'crawl' our database in order to copy large portions of it
  Scripts that run continously and request large amounts of data, say more than 
  one million points per hour.
  Scripts that continously send out more than 10 requests per minute.
  If you really need excessive amounts of data, please contact dl-euv-dashboard-support@asml.com

**Does something similar exist for MATLAB?**
  Yes! To use EUVDashboard/InfluxDB data in MATLAB you will need Influxmat.
  It can be downloaded here: https://euv-dashboard.asml.com/service/tools.html

**Python is complaining that it's missing a module!**
  If you're using Anaconda this shouldn't be the case, contact rob.de.laat@asml.com.
  If you're not using Anaconda you're on your own. Use tools like pip and
  google to figure out how to install additional packages or switch to Anaconda.

**Nothing seems to be working!**
  1. Uninstall the python provided by ITMS using the Software Center.
  2. Download and install anaconda (No admin rights required)
  3. Make sure to add the Anaconda and the Anaconda/scripts folder to your PATH
 
**Can I use this module in my python tool?**
  Probably, please contact dl-euv-dashboard-support@asml.com for the details.

**How can I list the contents of a DATv2 file?**
  Use the ls_dat() function provided by pyeuv.Parsers.dat_parser
