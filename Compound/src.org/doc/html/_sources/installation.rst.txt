Troubleshooting
---------------
Versions older than 0.5 can't be automatically upgraded or uninstalled by pip.
If you run into problems during the installation where pip complains that
the package is not in distutils format, or if you now that you have an old
version of pyeuv installed, please proceed as follows.

1. Go to your Anaconda installation directory. This is usually one of the following
   locations:

  ::
  
   C:\Localdata\Anaconda
   %APPDATA%\..\Local\Continuum\Anaconda

2. Go to the Lib/site-packages folder
3. Delete the following folders

  * pyeuv
  * pyeuv-<version nr>.egg-info
  * Any other files/folders starting with pyeuv
  
4. Retry the installation
