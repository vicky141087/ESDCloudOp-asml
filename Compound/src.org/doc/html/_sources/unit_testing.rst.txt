Unit testing
============

**NB: This section is intended for pyeuv developers**

The unit tests included in this module require test data to run. These files are
too large to be included in the SVN repository so they have been moved to the following
network share:

::

    \\asml.com\eu\shared\nl011150\WWW\nonconf\EUV\projects\Source\Tooling\pyeuv\test_data


Before running the tests, please copy all the files from this network share to the 
test_data folder of pyeuv.

To run these tests you will need the pytest package Most python
distributions such as Anaconda and WinPython include this package by default.

To start the tests, open a command prompt inside this directory and run the following command:

::

    pytest

Some tests require access to the EUV Dashboard so you will be prompted for your ASML password.

The PMA NG tests require a PMA account and API key. To avoid having to enter these details on every
test run it will attempt to read them from the following config file:

::

    %HOME%/.pyeuv/test_credentials.conf

Thils config file must have a PMA section containing a username, password and api_key field.

Example file:

::

    [PMA]
    username=MaryPoppins
    password=Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
    api_key=this-is-your-personal-or-application-pma-api-key
    [EUVDB]
    username=Mickey_Mouse
    password=Oswald_the_Lucky_Rabbit


Please make sure that this file exists before attempting to run the PMA tests, otherwise these
tests will fail.
